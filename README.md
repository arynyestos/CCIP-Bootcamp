# CCIP-Bootcamp
In August of 2024 I attended a bootcamp on Chainlink's CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol). This readme  contains the links to all the repos I worked on during the course.

The bootcamp was a 3-day program with an exercise on the first and third days, two on the second and homework for each day, all listed below.
